    <h2>Columbia University</h2>
    <p>
        As a master's student at the beautiful campus of Columbia University, I am deeply immersed in the field of deep learning.
        My coursework spans the breadth of the field, from foundational theories to cutting-edge applications 
        in computer vision and natural language processing. With amazing faculty and state-of-the-art resources, 
        I am developing a robust understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning.
        As an active member of the Columbia University AI society, I regularly engage with like-minded peers 
        to discuss and explore the latest advancements in the field. Additionally, my research in the COSMOS lab focuses on computer 
        vision applications on the edge, specifically for traffic monitoring and analysis on New York City streets. This combination 
        of rigorous academic training and practical experience is equipping me with the skills and knowledge to excel in the rapidly 
        evolving domain of machine learning.

        **Coursework**: Advanced Deep Learning, Deep Learning on the Edge, Applied Machine Learning, Statistical Learning, Algorithms,
        Natural Language Processing, Mathematics of Deep Learning
