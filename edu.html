    <h2>Columbia University</h2>
    <p>
        As a master's student at the beautiful campus of 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t51hOCs-Vog" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>,
        I am deeply immersed in the field of deep learning. My coursework spans the breadth of the field, from 
        foundational theories to cutting-edge applications in computer vision and natural language processing. 
        With amazing faculty and state-of-the-art resources, I am developing a robust understanding of both the 
        theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning.
        <br><br>
        As an active member of the CU AI society, I regularly engage with like-minded peers 
        to discuss and explore the latest advancements in the field. Additionally, my research in the 
        <a href="https://cosmos-lab.org/" target="_blank">COSMOS Lab</a> focuses on computer 
        vision applications on the edge, specifically for traffic monitoring and analysis on New York City streets. 
        This combination of rigorous academic training and practical experience is equipping me with the skills 
        and knowledge to excel in the rapidly evolving domain of machine learning.
