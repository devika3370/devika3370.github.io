      My responsibilities ranged from bug fixing and UI enhancements to developing backend solutions, managing deployment pipelines and
      designing application workflows.

      I was recognized with the prestigious <strong>Outstanding Contribution Award</strong> for my proactive approach and 
      problem solving capability that significantly improved project efficiency and client satisfaction. Beyond technical 
      contributions, my time at ZS taught me invaluable lessons in project management, teamwork, and client engagement, 
      laying a solid foundation for my career.
      <br><br>
      I actively participated in onboarding sessions and bootcamps, sharing my 
      expertise and contributing to the professional growth of new team members. My time at ZS, was a period of immense personal 
      and professional growth, where I honed my skills, expanded my knowledge, and developed a deep appreciation for the 
      impact of technology on business solutions.

    <h2>Asteria Aerospace</h2>
    <p>
      During my final year, I worked at <a href="https://asteria.co.in/" target="_blank">Asteria Aerospace</a> 
      as an Embedded Software Intern from June to December 2020. I developed a solution for autonomous indoor navigation 
      in the absence of GPS signals for Quadcopter drones, with visual-inertial odometry and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) 
      algorithms.<br><br>
      Using an Intel T265 camera and NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX edge devices, I engineered a system to process and
