# Introduction

Hello! I'm Devika (pronounciation [help](https://pronouncenames.com/search?name=devika)). I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Machine Learning at [Columbia University]().

Before joining Columbia, I spent two years as a Software Engineer at [ZS Associates](), where I developed applications for pharma companies. My role encompassed backend development, frontend development, and dev-ops, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of the software development lifecycle and the ability to contribute effectively across various stages of a project.

Currently, I am working as a researcher under the guidance of [Professor Zoran Kostic](https://sites.google.com/site/mobiledcc/zk-my-page?authuser=0) in the computer vision team at the [COSMOS Lab](https://cosmos-lab.org/).

My passion lies at the intersection of machine learning and computer vision. I am passionate about leveraging these technologies to solve complex problems and drive innovation. I am currently seeking full-time opportunities where I can apply my expertise, contribute to impactful projects, and continue to grow as a professional in the field.

I'm excited about the future of technology and eager to be part of teams that push the boundaries of what's possible. Let's connect and explore how we can achieve remarkable things together!
