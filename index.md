# Introduction

Hello! I'm Devika. I am currently pursuing MS in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Machine Learning at <a href="https://www.ee.columbia.edu/ms-program-ee" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>.

Before joining Columbia, I worked as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.zs.com/" target="_blank">ZS Associates</a> for two years, where I designed and developed analytical solutions for the pharmaceutical industry. My role comprised of backend development, frontend development, and DevOps, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of the software development lifecycle and the ability to contribute effectively across various stages of a project.

Currently, I am working as a researcher under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mobiledcc/zk-my-page?authuser=0" target="_blank">Professor Zoran Kostic</a> in the <a href="https://www.cosmos-lab.org/experimentation/smart-city-intersections/" target="_blank">computer vision team</a> at the <a href="https://cosmos-lab.org/" target="_blank">COSMOS Lab</a>.

My passion lies at the intersection of machine learning and computer vision. I am passionate about leveraging these technologies to solve complex problems and drive innovation.
